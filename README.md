BACKGROUND:
==========
* This app is meant for companies to keep track of their employee movements.

* Reason I designed this app is because intend to do a set up and I know how hard it can be to keep track of all employees.

* For small companies, the management can still use the hard copy files to keep track of employees, however if the company has a strength of more than 100 head counts, the manual process would be very tedious.
 



UX DESIGN:
==========
* The data is presented in a table format which allows users to see clearly at a glance how many employees are currently working in the particular company.  

* The table shows the following details as an example for the purpose of this project:

* The department that the employee is currently in. 

* Name and position of the said employee.

* Particulars of the employees, which for this project I limited it to just the company number. 

* This data also shows if the employee is currently on leave or if they are at work. 

* With this information, the management would be able to see how many headcounts they have currently which could be useful for them in terms of manpower deployment and they can use it to make informed decisions as to whether or not an increase in headcount is required for a specific department. 

* users can view all employees in a glace, Add new employees as and when they hire, update the status of current employees and of course delete those which have left the organization. 

USER STORIES:
============
My considerations while designing the app
* How to view all employees at a glance
* How does the HR personnel Create/Update/Delete employees from the system
